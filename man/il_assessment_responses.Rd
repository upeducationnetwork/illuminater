\title{Illuminate Assessment Responses}
\usage{
il_assessment_responses(connection, assessment_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{The connection object from your \code{il_connect} call}

\item{assessment_ids}{The Illuminate IDs of the assessments you want}
}
\value{
A list of data frames for each of assessments, fields and standards
}
\description{
Get individual responses for an assessment out of Illuminate.
}
\details{
The intended workflow is

- Get the metadata once, or once a week, or whatever
 - Get responses much more frequently and merge with stored metadata

There is relatively little behind-the-scenes joining,
instead returning a list of tidy data that the user can combine.

Available methods
\itemize{
 \item \code{il_assessment_metadata()}: Wrapper that returns assessments, fields and standards for a list of assessment ids.
 \item \code{il_assessements()}: Assessment-level data (e.g., name, local id)
 \item \code{il_fields()}: Fields-level data
 \item \code{il_standards()}: Stanards used in any fields
}
}
\examples{
c <- il_connect()
assessment_ids <- list(18672, 18657, 18677, 18679)

str(resps$students)
str(resps$student_responses)
